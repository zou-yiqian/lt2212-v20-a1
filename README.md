I chose not to make the text lowercase and did not remove punctuations and numbers.
The parameter n I chose is 100.

Part 2.
The parameter m I input is 10.
The top 10 is . , the to of in and said a for.

Part 4.
The top 10 changed, which are OPEC, bpd, barrels, nil, barrel, gas, crop, WHEAT, etroleum, maize.

Thus, the top 10 words in part 2 is very common to been seen in everywhere. But the results in Part 3 will be more important.

Part Bonus.
