I chose not to make the text lowercase and did not remove punctuations and numbers.
The parameter n I chose is 100.

Part 2.
The parameter m I input is 10.
The top 10 is . , the to of in and said a for.

Part 4.
The top 10 changed, which are OPEC, bpd, barrels, nil, barrel, gas, crop, WHEAT, etroleum, maize.
Since the importance of a word increases in proportion to the number of times it appears in the file, but at the same time it decreases inversely with the frequency of its qppearance in the corpus. Thus, the top 10 words in part 2 is very common to been seen in everywhere. But the results in Part 3 will be more important.
